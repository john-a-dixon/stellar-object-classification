### The Problem 

Based on light and space characteristics, can we easily classify a stellar observation as a star, galaxy, or quasar?

### The Stakeholders

The stakeholders would be another company performing similar work but without the proper means to verify the nature of their observation. Maybe they only have the ability to gather data but not the ability to classfify it. So, they'd need to rely on machine learning as a means of classification.
