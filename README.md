### The Problem 

Based on light characteristics, can we easily classify a stellar observation as a star, galaxy, or quasar?

### The Stakeholders

The stakeholders are a small astronomy company performing similar work but without the proper means to verify the nature of their observation. They only have the ability to gather light data but not the ability to classfify it. So, they'd need to rely on machine learning as a means of classification.
