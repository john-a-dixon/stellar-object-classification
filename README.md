# Stellar Object Classification

- **Source:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stellar-classification-dataset-sdss17
- **Description:** This dataset contains observations of space objects and their spectral information.
- **Number of rows:** 100000
- **Row meaning:** Each row is an observation of a space object that is potentially a star, galaxy, or quasar object.
- **Target:** Class; this is the class of the celestial object I want to predict.
- **Features:** There are 18 columns/features, but as of now I'll only use 11 within the feature matrix. This may change over the course of the project.
- **Classification or regression?:** This is a classification problem since I will be trying to predict a category.
- **Challenges:** Honestly, the main challenge I can foresee is understanding the meanings of the columns. This shouldn't be hard at all.
