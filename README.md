- **Row meaning:**
- **Target:**
- **Features:**
- **Classification or regression?:**
- **Challenges:**

## Second Choice Dataset

- **Source:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruthgn/beer-profile-and-ratings-data-set?select=beer_profile_and_ratings.csv
- **Description:** This dataset contains stats about beers that relate to their flavor profile and overall rating from a popular beer enthusiast website _BeerAdvocate_.
- **Number of rows:** 3198
- **Row meaning:** Each row is a unique beer.
- **Target:** Beer Style
- **Feature count:** There are 25 columns, but as of now I'll only use 20 within the feature matrix. This may change over the course of the project.
- **Classification or regression?:** This is a classification problem since I will be trying to predict a category.
- **Challenges:** The main challenge I forsee is unbalanced classes within the target. Some beers are more popular than others. Because of this, I believe there may be more of one class than another within the target. Additionally, since there are many beers in the world, it's possible the target may not be representative of every single type of beer. So, the resultant model may not be able to handle beers it has never seen. This is easily fixable by getting data on different beers, which can be done in the future.
